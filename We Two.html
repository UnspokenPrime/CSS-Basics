  <h1>We Two, How Long We Were Fool'd</h1>
  <h2> by Walt Whitman</h2>
  <p>We two, how long we were fool'd,</p>
  <p>Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,</p>
  <p>We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,</p>
  <p>We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,</p>
  <p>We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,</p>
  <p>We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,</p>
  <p>We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any,</p>
  <p>We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,</p>
  <p>We are what the locust blossoms are, we drop scent around the lanes, mornings and evenings,</p>
  <p>We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,</p>
  <p>We are two predatory hawks, we soar above, and look down,</p>
  <p>We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar—we are as two comets,</p>
  <p>We prowl fang’d and four-footed in the woods—we spring on prey,</p>
  <p>We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving overhead,</p>
  <p>We are seas mingling—we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other, and interwetting each other,</p>
  <p>We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious, impervious,</p>
  <p>We are snow, rain, cold, darkness—we are each product and influence of the globe,</p>
  <p>We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two,</p>
  <p>We have voiced all but freedom and all but our own joy.</p>
